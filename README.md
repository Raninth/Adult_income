## The Business problem

The business problem revolves around predicting an individual's annual income based on various influencing factors, such as education level, age, gender, and occupation. The dataset, sourced from KNN, serves as a comprehensive example for data pre-processing and machine learning practices. The task involves exploratory visualizations to uncover trends, feature engineering techniques like PCA and clustering, and assessing their impact on model performance. Additionally, feature selection methods and the integration of engineered data into model training are explored to enhance predictive accuracy. The comparison of models before and after feature engineering aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these techniques. The implementation of a small neural network with hyperparameter tuning using Keras further enriches the analysis, incorporating advanced techniques to optimize the predictive model. The ultimate goal is to derive actionable insights for stakeholders and enhance the accuracy of predicting individual income levels.
